## A simple shell built in Nim.

Nimbsh is a simple, open source OS shell with all the functionality under the sun!

> Nimbsh is still in development. More features such as control flow and basic scripting are 
planned to be added in the future. Thusly, some sections of this site are either incomplete or 
missing. If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to get in touch.
